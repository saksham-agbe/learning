Python is a popular programming language.  It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

Python can be used on a server to create web applications.

It is used for:

web development (server-side),
software development,
mathematics,
system scripting.

## Python Variables
* In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it

## Comments
* Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.
* Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment

## Statements
* A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
* In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

## Python Data Types
### Built-in Data Types
* Text Type: str
* Numeric Types: int, float, complex
* Sequence Types: list, tuple, range
* Mapping Type:	dict
* Set Types: set, frozenset
* Boolean Type:	bool

## Getting the data-type
* type() function

## Python List
mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
* Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage. Lists are created using square brackets.
* List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
* List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

* List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
* Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
* Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
* Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

## Tuples

* Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
* Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
* A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
* Tuples are written with round brackets.


## Python functions

* A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
* A function can return data as a result.
* A function helps avoiding code repetition.
* In Python, a function is defined using the def keyword, followed by a function name and parentheses

## Arguments
* Information can be passed into functions as arguments.
* Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.

## Parameters vs Arguments
* A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.
* An argument is the actual value that is sent to the function when it is called.

## Python modules
* Consider a module to be the same as a code library.
* A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.

## Python Dates
* A date in Python is not a data type of its own, but we can import a module named datetime to work with dates as date objects.
## Python Math
* Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module, that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

## Python JSON
* JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.
* JSON is text, written with JavaScript object notation.

## Python Try Except
* The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.
* The except block lets you handle the error.
* The else block lets you execute code when there is no error
* The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.

## Python Virtual Environment
* A virtual environment in Python is an isolated environment on your computer, where you can run and test your Python projects.
* It allows you to manage project-specific dependencies without interfering with other projects or the original Python installation.
* Think of a virtual environment as a separate container for each Python project. Each container:
* Has its own Python interpreter
* Has its own set of installed packages
* Is isolated from other virtual environments
* Can have different versions of the same package
* Using virtual environments is important because:
* It prevents package version conflicts between projects
* Makes projects more portable and reproducible
* Keeps your system Python installation clean
* Allows testing with different Python versions

## File Handling
* File handling is an important part of any web application.
* Python has several functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files.
"r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist

"a" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist

"w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist

"x" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists
